# 2DGauss_FFL_LD

## 1. Introduction 

### Purposes
To provide 

(1) AI training datasets 

(2) AI validating datasets 

(3) AI testing datasets.

(4) Evaluating and benchmarking AI performance by the UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators that achieve the Fisher information of single frames and entire data movie, respectively.

(5) Evaluating and benchmarking performance of conventional spatiotempoal localization algorithms by the UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators. 

### Type of localization and imaging system
**Localization:** Frame-by-frame localization (FFL) by AI or conventional localization algorithms. 

**System:** 2D imaging, Gaussian point spread functions (PSF), and low density (LD) of emitters. 

### AI input and output
AI can be trained, validated, tested, and benchmarked by a pair of input and output datasets. 

**Input:** A data frame consisting of PSFs for activated emitters through light diffraction. The data frames are generated by using the universal model of data frames in [5] [6]. All paramters are defined in [5] [6]. 

An example of data frame is shown below.

**Output**: A set of 2D coordinates, each being an emitter's location, used in generating  the data frame in the input. An example of emitter locations is shown below by the red dots over the corresponding data frame above.

## 2. Training datasets
Training datasets are in the folder: **Train** 

**2DGauss_FFL_LD_Frame.zip:** N data frames used as input in training of AI. The main parameters are given below.
 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Number of frames |N = 500 |frames |
|Number of emitters |M = 5 |emitters/frame |
|Emitter density |D = 0.5|emitters/um^2|
|Field of view (FOV) |[0, Lx] x [0, Ly] = [0, 3200] x [0, 3200]|nm| 
|Pixel size |Dx = 100, Dy = 100 | nm^2 |
|Frame size |Kx = 32, Ky = 32 |pixels |
|Emitter distribution| Random and uniform in FOV| |

**2DGauss_FFL_LD_xy.zip:** N txt files each containing M emitter locations. The 2D emitter locations (x,y) in nm in each file are listed row by row, e.g.

4.4184628e+02   5.0638849e+03

4.1254239e+02   6.8510823e+03

... ...

The input data frame "2DGauss_FFL_LD_Train_Frame_n.tif" and the corresponding output data file "2DGauss_FFL_LD_Train_xy_n.txt" have the same frame index n. 

## 3. Validating datasets

Validating datasets are in the folder: **Validate** 

The validating datasets, consisting of N = 50 pairs of input and output files, are generated using the same parameters as those of the training datasets. 

## 4. Testing datasets

Testing datasets are in the folder: **Test**  

Now AI is supposed to have been trained and to be tested. 

The testing datasets are a data movie of N = 500 frames where M = 600 emitters are located on a 2D helix. The 10th frame is shown below. 
 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Number of frames |N = 500 |frames |
|Number of emitters |M = 600 |emitters in specimen |
|Field of view (FOV) |[0, Lx] x [0, Ly] = [0, 6400] x [0, 6400]|nm| 
|Pixel size |Dx = 100, Dy = 100 | nm^2 |
|Frame size |Kx = 64, Ky = 64 |pixels |
|Emitter distribution| Helix| |

The emitter locations of white dots on the helix and the activated emitters of red dots over the 10th frame is shown below.

**Input:** The N = 500 frames are input to AI. 

**Output:** AI is supposed to output a list of estimated emitter locations, representing a superresolution SMLM image of the helix. 

## 5. Benchmarking and evaluating 

The quality of the reconstructed SMLM can be benchmarked by the UGIA-F [5-7] and UGIA-M [10] estimators that achieve the Fisher information of data movie and single frames, respectively. 

The quality metrics of the root mean square minimum distance (RMSMD) [7], RMSMD-P, and RMSE-P are used to evaluate the accuracy of reconstructed SMLM image in comparison with the ground truth emitter locations.

**UGIA-F estimator:** The UGIA-F estimator outputs an SMLM image as shown below. Its quality in terms of RMSMD is given in the table below. 




**UGIA-M estimator:** The UGIA-M estimator outputs an SMLM image as shown below. Its quality in terms of RMSMD is given in the table below. 







## 6. Other parameters
The  data frames are synthesized by using the following parameters. 

### Emitter distribution and intensity

|Analog digital unit |ADU = 1|photons/unit|

### Data frame 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Frame time |Dt = 0.01|sec|
|Correspondingly | |
|Frame rate|1/Dt = 100|frames/sec|
|Photon count |Dt\*I = 3000|photons/frame/emitter|

### Optical system
|Parameter |Variable and value|Unit | |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Numerical aperture |na = 1.40| | |
|Fluorescence wavelength |lambda = 723|nm|Dye Alexa 700 |
|Correspondingly| | | |
|Standard deviation |sigma = 108.81|nm| |
|Full-width half-maximum |FWHM = 256.22|nm| |

PSF is 2D Gaussian and its standard deviation is estimated from an Airy PSF by sigma = 1.3238/a where a = 2\*pi\*na/lambda [1]. 

### Noise 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Mean of Poisson noise |b = 5|photons/sec/nm<sup>2</sup>|
|Variance of Gaussian noise |G = 3|photons/sec/nm<sup>2</sup>| 
|Mean of Gaussian noise |mu = 5|photons/sec/nm<sup>2</sup>|

**Corresponding signal to noise ratios and camera offset**

|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Signal to Poisson noise ratio |rp = 60000|nm<sup>2</sup>/emitter|
|                             |SPNR = -3.97|dB|
|Signal to Gaussian noise ratio |rg = 100000|nm<sup>2</sup>/emitter|
|                             |SGNR = -1.75|dB|
|Total signal to noise ratio |r = 37500|nm<sup>2</sup>/emitter|
|                           |SNR = -6.01|dB|
|Effective camera offset |Coff = 500 |photons/pixel|

The mean of Gaussian noise mu includes the effect of camera offset. When mu is solely contributed by the camera offset, i.e. the Gaussian noise has a zero mean, the effective camera offset is Coff = Dt\*Dx\*Dy\*mu. 

SPNR, SGNR, and SNR are defined in [4].
