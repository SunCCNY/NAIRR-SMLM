## 1. Introduction 

### Purposes
To provide 

* AI training datasets
  
* AI validating datasets 

* AI testing datasets

* Evaluating and benchmarking AI performance by the UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators that achieve the Fisher information of single frames and entire data movie, respectively.
  
* Evaluating and benchmarking performance of conventional spatiotemporal localization algorithms by the UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators.

### Imaging system
2D imaging, Gaussian point spread function (PSF), and low density (LD) of emitters. 

### AI input and output
AI can be trained, validated, tested, and benchmarked by a pair of input and output datasets. 

**Input:** A data frame consisting of PSFs for activated emitters through light diffraction. The data frames are generated by using the universal model of data frames in [1] [2]. The emitter activation processes in testing and benchmarking are modeled by the Markov chain in [3]-[4]. All parameters are defined in [1]-[7]. 

An example of data frame is shown below.

**Output**: A set of 2D coordinates, each being a location of an activated emitter, used in generating  the data frame in the input. An example of emitter locations is shown below by the red dots over the corresponding data frame above.

## 2. Training datasets
Training datasets are in the folder: **Train** 

The training dataset consists of a data movie and the list of activated emitters in each frame. 

### Frame by frame datasets
Datasets are stored as individual frames.

The 10th frame with the activated emitters are shown above. 

**2DGauss_LD_Train_xy.zip:** N txt files each containing the list of activated emitter locations of 2D coordinates (x,y) in nm in the row-by-row format, e.g.

4.1254239e+02   6.8510823e+03

... ...

The input data frame "2DGauss_LD_Train_Frame_n.tif" and the corresponding output emitter-location file "2DGauss_LD_Train_xy_n.txt" have the same frame index n.

**Input:** The N frames are input to AI. 

**Output:** AI is supposed to output a list of estimated emitter locations, representing a superresolution SMLM image of the helix. 

## 5. Benchmarking 
Benchmarking datasets are in the folder: **Benchmark** 

For the purpose of benchmarking and evaluating, the dataset of ground-truth emitter locations is not provided. 

### Procedure 
A participant shall run a participating localization algorithm over the data movie in Benchmark to estimate a list of emitter locations. After the participant submits the list of estimated location, we will calculate its RMSMD in comparison with the ground-truth locations. The result will be posted in the leaderboard. 

### Dataset
The emitters with the same adjacent distance are located on a circle. The data movie for benchmarking is generated in the same way as Test dataset with the following parameters.  

|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Number of frames |N = 1000 |frames |
|Number of emitters |M = 200 |emitters in specimen |
|Emitter distribution| Circle | |
|Emitter distance |eD = 30|nm |

### Benchmarking and evaluating
The quality of the reconstructed SMLM is **benchmarked** by the UGIA-F [1-3] and UGIA-M [6] estimators that achieve the Fisher information of data movie and single frames, respectively. Both UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators are theoretical estimators. 

The quality metrics of the root mean square minimum distance (RMSMD) [3], RMSMD-P, and RMSE-P [5] are used to **evaluate** the accuracy of reconstructed SMLM image in comparison with the ground truth emitter locations.

### Performance of UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators

**UGIA-F estimator:** The UGIA-F estimator outputs an SMLM image as shown below. Its quality in terms of RMSMD is listed in the leaderboard.
