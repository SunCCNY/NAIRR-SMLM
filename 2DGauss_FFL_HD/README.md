## 1. Introduction 

### Purposes

### Type of localization and imaging system
**Localization:** Frame-by-frame localization (FFL) by AI or conventional localization algorithms. 

**System:** 2D imaging, Gaussian point spread function (PSF), and high density (HD) of emitters. 

### AI input and output
AI can be trained, validated, tested, and benchmarked by a pair of input and output datasets. 

**Input:** A data frame consisting of PSFs for activated emitters through light diffraction. The data frames are generated by using the universal model of data frames in [1] [2]. The emitter activation processes in testing and benchmarking are modeled by the Markov chain in [3]-[4]. All paramters are defined in [1]-[7]. 

An example of data frame is shown below.

**Output**: A set of 2D coordinates, each being an emitter's location, used in generating  the data frame in the input. An example of emitter locations is shown below by the red dots over the corresponding data frame above.

## 2. Training datasets
Training datasets are in the folder: **Train** 

### Frame by frame datasets
Datasets are stored as individual frames. 

**2DGauss_FFL_HD_Train_Frame.zip:** N data frames used as input in training of AI. The main parameters are given below.

The emitters are randomly distributed and independent frame by frame. 
 
|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit| 
|:-----|:-----|:-----| 
|Number of frames |N = 500 |frames | 
|Number of emitters |M = 81 |emitters/frame | 
|Emitter density |D = 2|emitters/um^2| 
|Field of view (FOV) |[0, Lx] x [0, Ly] = [0, 3200] x [0, 3200]|nm| 
|Pixel size |Dx = 100, Dy = 100 | nm^2 | 
|Frame size |Kx = 32, Ky = 32 |pixels | 
|Emitter distribution| Random and uniform in FOV| | 
|Emitter activation| independent frame by frame | | 

**2DGauss_FFL_HD_Train_xy.zip:** N txt files each containing M emitter locations. The 2D emitter locations (x,y) in nm in each file are listed row by row, e.g.

4.4184628e+02   5.0638849e+03

4.1254239e+02   6.8510823e+03

... ...

The input data frame "2DGauss_FFL_HD_Train_Frame_n.tif" and the corresponding output emitter-location file "2DGauss_FFL_HD_Train_xy_n.txt" have the same frame index n. 

### Movie datatsets
Datasets are also concisely stored as an entire data movie of all frames as below.  

**2DGauss_FFL_HD_Train_Frame.tif:** N data frames. 

**2DGauss_FFL_HD_Train_xy.csv:** All activated emitter locations. 

## 3. Validating datasets

Validating datasets are in the folder: **Validate** 

The validating datasets, consisting of N = 50 pairs of input and output files, are generated using the same parameters as those of the training datasets. 

## 4. Testing datasets

Testing datasets are in the folder: **Test**  

Now AI is supposed to have been trained and to be tested. 

The testing datasets are a data movie where emitters are located on a 2D helix. The parameters of each frame are listed below.  

The emitters are independently activated frame by frame following a model of Markov chain [4]. 

|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Number of frames |N = 500 |frames |
|Number of emitters |M = 600 |emitters in specimen |
|Field of view (FOV) |[0, Lx] x [0, Ly] = [0, 6400] x [0, 6400]|nm| 
|Pixel size |Dx = 100, Dy = 100 | nm^2 |
|Frame size |Kx = 64, Ky = 64 |pixels |
|Emitter distribution| Helix| |
|**Emitter distance**|**eD = 30**|**nm** |
|Emitter activation| Markov chain frame by frame | |
|Frame time | Dt = 0.01 | sec |
|Mean deactivation time | t0 = 0.9 | sec |
|Mean activation time | t1 = 0.05 | sec |
|Mean photoactivatable time| t = 8 | sec |

The 10th frame is shown below.

**Input:** The N frames are input to AI. 

**Output:** AI is supposed to output a list of estimated emitter locations, representing a superresolution SMLM image of the helix. 

## 5. Benchmarking and evaluating 
For the purpose of benchmarking and evaluating, the dataset of ground-truth emitter locations is not provided. 

### Procedure of evaluating
A participant shall run a participating localization algorithm over the data movie in Benchmark to estimate a list of emitter locations. After the participant submits the list of estimated location, we will calculate its RMSMD in comparison of the ground-truth locations. The result will be posted in the leaderboard. 

### Dataset
The emitters with the same adjacent distance are located on a circle. The data movie for benchmarking and evaluation is generated in the same way but the following parameters are set differently.  

|Parameter |Variable and value| Unit|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Number of frames |N = 500 |frames |
|Number of emitters |M = 200 |emitters in specimen |
|Emitter distribution| Circle | |
|**Emitter distance**|**eD = 30**|**nm** |
|Mean deactivation time |t0 = 0.90 | sec |
|Mean activation time |t1 = 0.05 | sec |
|Mean photoactivatable time| t = 8 | sec |

The 10th frame is shown below.

### Benchmarking and evaluating
The quality of the reconstructed SMLM can be benchmarked by the UGIA-F [1-3] and UGIA-M [6] estimators that achieve the Fisher information of data movie and single frames, respectively. Both UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators are theoretical estimators. 

The quality metrics of the root mean square minimum distance (RMSMD) [3], RMSMD-P, and RMSE-P [5] are used to evaluate the accuracy of reconstructed SMLM image in comparison with the ground truth emitter locations.

### Performance of UGIA-F and UGIA-M estimators

**UGIA-F estimator:** The UGIA-F estimator outputs an SMLM image as shown below. Its quality in terms of RMSMD is given in the table below.
