# NAIRR-SMLM
Datasets and benchmark for AI in single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). 

Other types of spatiotemproal localization algorithms can also be benchmarked. 

# Datasets
Each dataset consists of two part: (1) a data movie consisting of a sequence of data frames, and (2) a set of coordinates of emitter locations that are used in generation of the data movie. 

# Training of AI
AI can be trained using a dataset: (1) the data movie is the input of AI, and (2) the set of emitter locations is the output of AI.
